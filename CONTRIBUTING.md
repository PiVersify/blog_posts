#How to submit an article to the blog

 1. If you haven't already, go to [Github][1] and create an account
 2. Download Github Desktop from [here][2] and install it. Follow all on-screen instructions to sign in etc. Keep it open in the background.
 3. Go to the repository [here][3] and click the 'fork' button in the top right:

4. When the repository is 'forked' to your account, click the 'clone' button to download it to your computer

5. When it prompts you where to save the project, leave it as the default (`My Documents\Github\Repo-name`) or put it somewhere else. Press OK and wait for it to clone.

6. Navigate to the repository and make your changes (i.e. copy paste your article, written in markdown, into the root of the project with the filename in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_post_title.md`)

7. In Github Desktop, use the dropdown in the top left to switch to the `drafts` branch. (switch to the `drafts` branch rather than PiVersify/drafts, as this is your forked copy)

11. Press the 'pull request' button in the top right. Switch the branch to be merged to `PiVersify/drafts`. Add an appropriate title and description.
