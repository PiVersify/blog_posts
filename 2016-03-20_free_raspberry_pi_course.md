# Free Raspberry Pi IoT Course from Digikey #
  
DigiKey, through their Continuing Education Center is sponsoring "***Building Raspberry Pi Devices and Data Displays for the Internet of Things***." The course runs March 21-25 for an hour a day (2-3 PM Eastern Time). If you can't attend during the live presentation, the presentations and slide decks are posted (usually later the same day).

## The Curriculum

**March 21 - Day 1**: Building a Raspberry Pi LED Flasher 

Course participants will be introduced to the state of the Internet of Things with respect to microcontroller-based development platforms like the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. This kickoff session will instruct attendees on building an RPi LED flasher that will serve as the experimental IoT device for the weeklong course.
	
**March 22 - Day 2**: Understanding Mashups, Dweepy Library, and dweet.io Cloud Server 

In this session, participants will learn about the world of mashups and their interaction with IoT platforms. The class will be introduced to the Dweepy Python library by investigating a Raspberry Pi-based IoT device example. Also, use of the dweet.io cloud server, a free data aggregator website, will be discussed. The hands-on lab will consist of building a dweet.io Raspberry Pi IoT device.

**March 23 - Day 3**: Modifying the Python RPi LED Flasher Code for dweet.io Cloud Server 

This class will show participants how to modify the RPi LED flasher built in the Day 1 class to work with the dweet.io cloud website. Specific dweet.io details on programming scripts and URL resources will be explored.

**March 24 - Day 4**: Introduction to the Freeboard.io Cloud Server 

The Freeboard.io cloud website will be introduced in this class, with a discussion on dashboards, triggers, and IO sources. Elements on URL resources from dweet.io will be demonstrated by use of a smartphone. The concepts based on this hands-on demonstration will be used in building the RPi LED Flasher Freeboard Dashboard in the final session of the weeklong course.

**March 25 - Day 5**: Building the RPi LED Flasher Freeboard Dashboard 

The final session of this course will consist of building a basic Freeboard Dashboard for the RPi LED flasher. Participants can follow along by way of the course slides, in building a real-time
